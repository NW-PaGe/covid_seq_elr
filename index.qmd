This website gives an overview of how COVID-19 sequencing metadata are transmitted to the Washington State Department of Health (WA DOH) via Electronic Lab Reporting (ELR) and stored in one of Washington's disease surveillance systems.

-   [**Overview**](index.qmd) gives an overview of ELR data submitted by labs to WA DOH

-   [**Strengths & Challenges**](pages/strengths.qmd) evaluates the different reporting methods used at WA DOH for sequencing metadata

-   [**Data Flow**](pages/flow.qmd) describes a high-level overview of how data travel from sequencing labs to surveillance system end-users

-   [**WDRS**](pages/wdrs.qmd) explains where sequencing metadata live inside the Washington Disease Reporting System

-   [**DRIVE**](pages/drive.qmd) details DRIVE processing and how KOPs are assigned to messages/MIFs

-   [**Example Data**](pages/example.qmd) shows the data structure of sequencing metadata submitted to WA DOH via ELR

-   [**Federal Guidance**](pages/guidance.qmd) lists recommendations from national public health organizations around sequencing ELR's

-   **Quest**: September 2021
-   **Helix**: October 2021
-   **Aegis**: February 2022 (submissions ended April 2023)
