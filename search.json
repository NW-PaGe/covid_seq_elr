    "text": "WDRS is a Maven-based electronic disease surveillance system used in Washington State. WDRS is used to receive, process, track, and analyze data for 64+ notifiable conditions in Washington State, including COVID-19.\nWDRS is Event-based, where an Event is the association of a person with a disease at a point in time. For conditions like COVID-19, one person can be associated with multiple Events for the same condition. A person can also be associated with Events for multiple conditions tracked through WDRS.\nSequencing data submitted to WA DOH come in with varying formats, including secure file transfer of comma-separated values files and ELR. Data are ingested into a workflow which outputs a roster to populate a Question Package in WDRS. This Question Package is associated at the Event-level. After ELR data are standardized and imported into the Question Package, these data will exist as a lab result (Figure 1) associated with the Event and as an instance of the Question Package (Figure 2).\nSequencing ELRs are associated with Events in a similar format that any other test results would be. A new lab is created which contains the HL7 message, standardized and reformatted to fit in the WDRS data structures. This visual shows an example of part of an ELR residing in the WDRS frontend:\nTo make data more usable for disease investigators and genetic epidemiologists, these data are moved to a Question Package in WDRS, which is linked to the Event. Question Packages are customization by WDRS developers at WA DOH and contain sets of questions related to a variety of topics from Occupation and Industry to Molecular Genetics. Sequencing metadata are stored in one Question Package. Values stored there include GISAID/NCBI virus names and accession numbers, lineages1, specimen collection dates, sequencing lab names, and clinical accessions2. This visual shows an example of sequencing metadata stored in a Question Package in the WDRS frontend:\nReporting sequencing data to WA DOH via ELR is preferable to other methods because it should enter WDRS already associated with an existing or new Event. Data sent via ELR are linked to existing Events and Persons based on a variety of identifiers (First Name, Last Name, Date of Birth, Social Security Number, etc.) and workflows (automated matching & manual review)."

    "text": "Overview\n\nDRIVE (Disease Reporting and Interoperability Verification Engine) is a Rhapsody-based system that performs the middleware processing of ELRs between WELRS and WDRS. DRIVE reformats data, standardizes values for the widely varying information received from different reporting laboratories, and sends ELRs on to WDRS for workflow processing and end-user evaluation.\n\n\nThe DRIVE team also manages the MPI person-matching process which utilizes vendors to create matching algorithms and person databases. This occurs after WELRS processing and before DRIVE.\n\n\nDRIVE was developed by the DOH Tech Ops team. Workflows for processing ELR messages and importing them into WDRS are managed by the DOH WDRS team. These workflows include the management of key output pairs (KOPs) which are used for standardizing values in WDRS. The WDRS team works with the ELR team, as well, on DRIVE change requests and testing.\n\n\n\nValue Standardization and KOPs\n\nDuring value standardization, DRIVE fills standardized values in fields prefixed with “WDRS_” using KOPs to determine these values. In the case of sequencing, where data are often free-text and often changing (e.g., submission of new lineages), WDRS staff must semi-manually create new KOPs for the newly-encountered, non-standardized values.\n\n\nAs WELRs reformats HL7 messages into MIFs (XML formatting), fields which may be standardized during processing by DRIVE are filled with the value “TBD_BY_DRIVE+”. SQL tables exist which contain MIFs after WELRs processing (DRIVE.SavedMIF), as well as MIFs after DRIVE processing (DRIVE.OutputMIF). Comparing WELRs and DRIVE MIFs may be useful when troubleshooting DRIVE errors."
